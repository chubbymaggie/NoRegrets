* Examples we need to reason about

Example 1:
  Currently, the heap walker will visit deeply visit the complexObject.
  We have to understand the implications of this.
  Are we maybe generating spurious tests that are testing the library?


  client:
    var complexObject = ...;
    module.validate(complexObject);


  module:
    var validate = function (o) {
      return o.has(...);
  }



* Things needed
- Add test case to very correct behavior of apply, call, and bind.
